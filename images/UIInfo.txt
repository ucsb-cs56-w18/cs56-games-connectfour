      All User Interface Updates are done using the basic photoshop files included within the images
directory. All the buttons and labels were created using these two photoshop files, with the 
flair file being used for more flashy display, such as the main menu, and the other one being used
for basic images. I have included them here in case someone wishes to create more buttons.

Steps:
1) Open the type of button you wish to create (Flair or Regular) within photoshop.
2) Modify the text field layer by using the text tool while having the text layer selected,
and simply clicking on the words. This will allow you to edit the words without changing anything
else, such as the background.
3) Save as a png file and reduce the files resolution to about 300 width and 200 height. You can do 
this online at any resizing website.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This resize step is extremely important as not doing this will result in lag during loading between
scenes in the game, and be a waste of memory.

4) Drag the final png file into the images directory of this game.
5) Profit
